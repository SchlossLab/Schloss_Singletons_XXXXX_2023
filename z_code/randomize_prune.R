# This script reads in data.count_table from the user specified directory set in 'path'. It then
# randomizes the order of the groups that each sequence belongs to so that every sample still has
# the same number of sequences. The randomization is fiexd by the seed value provided as 'seed'.
# This randomization will effectively build a null distribution of sequences across samples. It
# then applies a pruning step by removing those reads whose frequency is below the user specified
# value set as 'min_class'. Finally, it outputs a three column random_mapping file that indicates
# the sample name, the sequence name, and the number of times that sequence is seen in that sample.
#
# Expected input: A directory (e.g. data/bioethanol/) that contains a file named data.count_table
#   and one named data.remove_accnos
#	Output: A file named data.seed.min_class.random_mapping that is deposited in the directory
#   indicated by path
